### The Premise
Ever since I started my journey into machine learning in grade 11, I have been mystified by how unavailable people's findings are for applied papers. I would read papers about people training amazing algorithms that could do things like predicting life expectancy from pictures of people's faces, and all I wanted was to try it for myself and have access to the algorithm. However, recreating the papers' results is a challenge in itself, making the concrete results inaccessible and impossible to play with. In essence, much of the power that cutting-edge AI research has is held by a select few.  

I want to create a platform that enables people to put their trained algorithms online in an accessible way so that lay people can use them easily. I want a platform that a random student with no coding experience can find and play around with cutting-edge algorithms in an easy and productive way. I want to make a platform that connects machine learning enthusiasts and researchers directly to people who can use their discoveries and algorithms. In essence, I want to democratize AI.
